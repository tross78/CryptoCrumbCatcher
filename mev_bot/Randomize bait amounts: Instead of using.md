Randomize bait amounts: Instead of using fixed bait amounts, introduce randomness to the bait amounts in the contract. This can make it harder for MEV bots to identify a pattern or rule out the contract as a trap.
solidity
Copy code
function updateBaitAmounts() external {
    baitAmountTokenA = (block.timestamp % 1000) * 10**18; // Randomize bait amounts using the block timestamp
    baitAmountTokenB = (block.timestamp % 1000) * 10**18;
}
Implement a more complex swap function: Instead of a simple baitSwap function, implement a more complex swap function that takes slippage, fees, and other parameters into account, making the contract appear more like a legitimate DeFi platform.

Introduce additional DeFi features: Add features commonly found in DeFi contracts, such as liquidity provisioning, staking, or yield farming. This can make the contract more difficult to differentiate from a legitimate DeFi platform.

Use a proxy contract: Deploy a proxy contract that forwards transactions to the actual Salmonella Contract. This can help obfuscate the contract's true nature and make it harder for bots to analyze its code.

Dynamic reversion conditions: Instead of always reverting the baitSwap transaction, introduce dynamic conditions for reversion. For example, revert only when specific conditions are met, such as a certain number of attempts by the same address or when gas prices are above a certain threshold.

Time-based or event-based bait transactions: Trigger bait transactions based on specific time intervals or external events, making it harder for MEV bots to predict when a bait transaction will occur.
